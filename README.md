# prgf

Prgf aims to be an easiy to modify command line tool for creating basic        
programming files.

"What is a basic programming file?"

A basic programming file in this sense means a file filled with all the boiler plate                
needed already in it so you could call prgf and imeaditely run it!

## C exmaple

'''
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Get going!\n");

    return 0;
